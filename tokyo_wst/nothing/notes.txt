shellcode on stack at address 0x7fffffffda70
user input 6th element popped by printf from stack (?)

printf@got.plt address = 0x00000000004005b0 => jmp 0x601028

set {int}0x601028=0xdeadbeef => redirects rip to 0x7fffdeadbeef



steps:-
	put shellcode on stack
	redirect rip to 0x7fffffffda70 by doing:
		set {int}0x601028=0x7fffffffda70
